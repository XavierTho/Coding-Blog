    "The first thing to note is how we can index our string to extract different characters of our choosing. Each character in a string is assigned a number, starting from 0 and ending at *n*. To index one of these characters, we format the code in the following manner: **string[number of said character]**. Not only are characters in a string assigned a positive integer but a negative one as well, which allows us to get characters in reverse order. The above code provides an example of how this works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second noteworthy topic above is String Slicing, in which instead of extracting a singular character, we are given the ability to extract a range of such. We use a colon (**:**) to denote that want to get the range. **An important thing to mention is that when selecting the range, the last value of said range will not be included**.\n",

    "Now before we go any further into the next topic, which is how we can edit and change strings, we must first understand an important feature of strings. This feature is the fact that strings are immutable values, meaning once they have been defined, they cannot be changed. There isn't any way to really workaround this, the best method in which one can use is to take the contents of the original string and use it to create a new string that will carry on our modifications. Once again, the following methods will be shown below then explained afterwards."
